## Files Needing Additional Tests

### Priority 1: Action Classes (User-Facing)
1. **pipeline-status.ts** (57.39% → 80%)
   - Uncovered: Settings debouncing, polling initialization, error scenarios
   - Note: Coverage dropped after refactoring to use new utilities
   
2. **pr-checks.ts** (72.27% → 80%)
   - Uncovered: Settings encryption, error handling paths, Property Inspector communication

### Priority 2: Infrastructure
1. **settings-manager.ts** (62.39% → 80%)
   - Uncovered: Migration logic, validation edge cases, default settings

2. **connection-pool.ts** (78.21% → 80%)
   - Uncovered: Connection timeout scenarios, pool exhaustion

3. **error-recovery.ts** (76.19% → 80%)
   - Uncovered: Complex retry scenarios, circuit breaker edge cases

## Improvements Made
✅ **visual-feedback.ts**: 12.28% → 97.36% coverage (+85.08%)
✅ **performance-optimizer.ts**: 12.32% → 91.09% coverage (+78.77%)

## Quick Wins (Easy to Test)
1. Add tests for `pipeline-status.ts` polling and error scenarios
2. Test `settings-manager.ts` migration and validation logic
3. Cover remaining branches in `connection-pool.ts`

## Medium Effort
1. Test Property Inspector communication flows in action classes
2. Add comprehensive error scenario tests for `error-recovery.ts`
3. Improve branch coverage across all files

## Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. `memory-leak-detector.ts` - Development utility
2. Type definition files - No runtime code

## Test Coverage Goals
- **Current**: 75.92% statements, 65.89% branches (approaching thresholds)
- **Short term**: Meet all thresholds (80% statements/functions/lines, 70% branches)
- **Long term**: Maintain >85% coverage for all production code

## Next Steps
1. Fix integration test failures to ensure robust testing
2. Add tests for `pipeline-status.ts` to restore coverage above 70%
3. Complete testing for `settings-manager.ts` edge cases
4. Consider excluding development utilities from coverage requirements
